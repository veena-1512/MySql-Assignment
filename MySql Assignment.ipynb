    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that makes it easy to manage, retrieve, and update. Databases are used in various applications and systems to store and retrieve data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of databases: SQL (Structured Query Language) databases and NoSQL databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiation between the two SQL and NoSQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured Query Language (SQL): SQL is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is a standardized language for interacting with databases and is used to perform tasks such as querying data, updating data, inserting data, and more.\n",
    "Data Structure: SQL databases are relational and use a predefined schema to define the structure of the data. Data is organized into tables with rows and columns, and relationships between tables are established using keys.\n",
    "Scalability: SQL databases are typically vertically scalable, meaning you can increase the capacity of a single server by increasing things like CPU, RAM, or SSD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of SQL databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Not Only SQL (NoSQL): NoSQL databases are a broad class of database management systems that are not based on the traditional relational database model. They are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and provide more flexibility in data models.\n",
    "Data Structure: NoSQL databases can have various data models, including document-oriented, key-value pairs, wide-column stores, and graph databases. They do not require a fixed schema, allowing for more dynamic and flexible data storage.\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are typically horizontally scalable, meaning you can add more servers to your NoSQL database to handle larger loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of NoSQL databases: MongoDB (document-oriented), Cassandra (wide-column store), Redis (key-value store), Neo4j (graph database).\n",
